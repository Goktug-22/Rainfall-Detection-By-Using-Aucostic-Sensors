# Rainfall Detection By Using Acustic Sensors
This project describes the working process of a embedded system to detect rainfall.
Acustic sensors are placed on the windshield of a car to detect rainfall with the vibrations created by the droplets on the windshield and automatically turn on the wiper servos.
